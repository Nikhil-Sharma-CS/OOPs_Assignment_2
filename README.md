# Data Flow

## Classes Section
-   *This section contains a Coffee Machine Class and a Main class* :

* ### CoffeeMachine Class
    - This class contains all necessary data types and methods which will be used to provide functionality to our coffee machine. 

    - One such method is start. Which when invoked starts our coffee machine with a display message and various types of options showing user what he/she can perform.


* ### Main Class
    - Here we take the input from user as whether he wants to start machine or not, and if he does than we enter our CoffeeMachine class.

## Database Design
- *This program uses basic integer variables to store data. The data is not persistent in the program i.e., as soon as the program is terminated the data is lost.*

## Summary

*This project demonstrates various OOPs concepts like **Abstraction**, **Polymorphism** etc*.

*This is coded in **Java** language.*

*All in all this program can demonstrate the dispense of 3 kinds of coffee viz., Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte. It generates bill accordingly.*
